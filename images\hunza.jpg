This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a beautiful and responsive frontend website for Pakistan Tourism. The website features a hero section with a background image of Pakistan, a navigation menu, an about section, a destinations section with cards, a contact section with a form, and a footer. The website is fully functional and can be run directly in CodeSandbox.
